    <h1>About Thyfault Time</h1>
    <p class = "info">
      Thyfault Time was created in 2014 by Brian Thyfault. The crew has seen various new additions over the years, and updates a current listing.
      The purpose of Thyfault Time is very straightforward: help the public through public service announcements, and have fun while doing so.
